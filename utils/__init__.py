# utils/__init__.py
# This file makes the 'utils' directory a Python package.

# You can optionally import modules here to make them available
# when the package is imported, e.g.:
# from . import admission_number
# from . import pdf_utils
# from . import validators
# from . import caching

# For now, we'll keep it simple.
